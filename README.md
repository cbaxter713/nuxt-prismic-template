# nuxt-prismic-template

> A Basic Nuxt project with Prismic headless CMS integration.

## Prerequisites
Nuxt requires your base `node` version to be at least `8.0`.
We recommend using `nvm` to manage the node versions on your machine.
Learn how to [install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if you don't already have it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

# deploy project to heroku
$ npm run deploy:heroku
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Troubleshooting
> Sometimes the global `node-sass` setup on your machine can go awry. If you try running the project and encounter errors related to `node-sass`, run the following command to clear up that issue: `npm rebuild node-sass`
