This component styleguide serves as the main reference for all non-page components in the project.

This project uses [Vue Styleguidist](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/) for component documentation.

To run the component style guide locally, simply run:
`npm run styleguide`

All relevant components automatically have their Vue props documented by name, type and required attributes.  When adding any components it is strongly recommended that you add additional documentation for basic descriptions, events, examples, etc.
